This challenge became a lot easier for me when I stopped focusing so much on the tree or triangular shape that the numbers were in and more on the relationship 
between the numbers.


def solution(x,y):
    #difference is calculated so that the calculation is moving diagonally down
    difference = y-1
    #finding the corner of the triangle
    tri_cor = x + difference
    #relationship between the numbers moving diangonally
    id = tri_cor * (tri_cor +1) //2 - difference
    difference -= difference
    return str(id)
